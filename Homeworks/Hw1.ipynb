        "\n",
        "**NumPy :** NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific calculation in Python. Hence, it is used for inserting any type of mathematical operation in the code. Using NumPy, we can also add large multidimensional arrays and matrices in your code. \n",

        "**Pandas :** Pandas is an excellent open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It is extensively used for importing and managing the datasets. It packs in high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Calculating the mean:** This method is useful for features having numeric data like age, salary, year, etc. This method can add variance to the dataset, and any loss of data can be efficiently negated. Hence, it yields better results compared to the first method (omission of rows/columns). Another way of approximation is through the deviation of neighbouring values. However, this works best for linear data.\n",

The ML model uses the test set to predict outcomes.The validation set is used to evaluate a given model, but this is for frequent evaluation. \n",
